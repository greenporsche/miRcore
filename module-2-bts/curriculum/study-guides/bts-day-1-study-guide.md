## Concept Summaries

### What Is Biotechnology?
Biotechnology is a broad field that applies biological knowledge and techniques to develop products and technologies. In this camp, students explore the intersection of biology and computer science through bioinformatics. Real-world biotech examples discussed on Day 1 include: the production of synthetic insulin using recombinant DNA technology (the first biotech product), CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing for treating genetic diseases like sickle cell disease, PCR-based COVID-19 diagnostic testing, and Illumina's next-generation sequencing platforms that can read billions of DNA fragments simultaneously.

The camp introduces the concept of wet lab versus dry lab research. Wet labs involve physical experiments with chemicals and biological samples, while dry labs use computers to analyze data. Bioinformatics --- the focus of this camp --- is firmly in the dry lab category, using computational tools to make sense of the massive amounts of data generated by modern sequencing technology.

### SARS-CoV-2 Biology
SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. It is an RNA virus with a genome of approximately 29,903 nucleotides, making it one of the largest RNA virus genomes known. The virus contains several important proteins, but the most significant for infection is the spike protein (S-protein), located at base pairs 21,563 to 25,384 on the genome.

The spike protein is crucial because it is the molecular "key" that allows the virus to enter human cells. It binds to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of human cells, triggering a process that lets the virus inject its RNA into the cell. This is why the spike protein is the primary target for vaccines --- by training the immune system to recognize the spike, vaccines can prevent the virus from gaining entry. Understanding the spike protein's genomic location and structure is the first step in the BTS camp's research project.

### Introduction to NCBI
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a foundational resource for bioinformatics. It hosts databases containing DNA sequences, protein sequences, published scientific literature, and more. On Day 1, students learn to use NCBI to look up the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (accession number NC_045512.2), switch between FASTA view (raw sequence text) and Graphics view (visual map of genes and proteins), and locate specific features like the spike protein.

NCBI is an essential skill for any bioinformatics researcher because it provides the reference data against which experimental results are compared. The reference genome acts as a "gold standard" --- when you sequence a patient sample, you align the reads against this reference to see where they match and where they differ.

### Linux Basics and the Great Lakes Cluster
The Great Lakes cluster is the University of Michigan's high-performance computing resource. Students connect to it using SSH (Secure Shell), which creates an encrypted connection from their local computer to the remote Linux server. Authentication requires both a password and two-factor authentication via Duo Mobile.

Once logged in, students work entirely through the command line (terminal). The basic Linux commands learned on Day 1 form the foundation for all subsequent work. `pwd` (print working directory) shows your current location in the file system. `ls` lists files and directories. `mkdir` creates new directories. `cd` changes your current directory. `cp` copies files. `cat` displays file contents. These commands may seem simple, but they are the building blocks of all bioinformatics analysis performed on the cluster throughout the camp.

### FASTA Format and Protein Structures
The FASTA format is one of the most common file formats in bioinformatics. Each sequence entry begins with a header line starting with `>`, followed by a description (often including an accession number and species name). Subsequent lines contain the actual nucleotide (A, T, G, C) or amino acid sequence. FASTA files are plain text and can be viewed with any text editor or the `cat` command.

Students also learn about protein structures through the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which contains experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins. By looking up the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on PDB, students can visualize the physical shape of the protein they are studying, connecting the abstract sequence data from NCBI to a tangible molecular structure.

## How It Connects
- **Previous Day**: This is Day 1, the starting point. Some students may have attended a prior Computational Biology (CB) camp, but no prerequisites are assumed for the BTS track.
- **Next Day**: Day 2 builds on Linux skills by introducing more advanced commands (`grep`, `wc`, `head`), introduces the FASTQ file format (sequences plus quality scores), and begins covering next-generation sequencing concepts. The business pitch component also begins.

## Review Questions

4. Describe the FASTA file format --- what does the first line look like, and what follows?
5. What Linux command would you use to see what directory you are currently in?
6. If you are in `/home/student/data/` and want to go up to `/home/student/`, what command would you use?
7. Why is a high-performance computing cluster necessary for bioinformatics work?
8. What is the difference between NCBI's FASTA view and Graphics view for a genome?
