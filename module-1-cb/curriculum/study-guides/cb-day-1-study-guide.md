## Concept Summaries

### What Is miRcore and Why Computational Biology?
miRcore is a nonprofit organization founded by Dr. Inhan Lee that connects scientists and the public through education. The computational biology (CB) summer camp teaches high school students how to use real bioinformatics tools to conduct genuine research on genetic diseases. Over five days, students progress from foundational biology concepts to performing actual data analysis and presenting their findings — the same workflow used by professional researchers.

The camp emphasizes that research is a collaborative process. Students work in small groups guided by group leaders, and the experience is deliberately different from a typical school setting. The goal is not just to learn facts, but to develop research skills: asking questions, finding data, analyzing it, and communicating results.

### Genes and Disease
Every cell in your body contains the same DNA — approximately 3 billion base pairs organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Within those chromosomes are roughly 20,000–25,000 genes, each of which provides instructions for making a specific protein. When a gene has a mutation (a change in its DNA sequence), the resulting protein may not function correctly, which can lead to disease.

Some diseases are caused by mutations in a single gene (monogenic diseases). For example, sickle cell anemia results from a single nucleotide change in the HBB gene on chromosome 11. Other diseases, like diabetes or heart disease, are polygenic — they involve variations in many genes interacting with environmental factors. Understanding which genes are involved in a disease is the first step toward developing targeted treatments.

### Precision Medicine
Traditional medicine often uses a one-size-fits-all approach: if you have a certain disease, you receive a standard treatment. But patients are not identical — they have different genetic makeups that affect how they respond to drugs and how their diseases progress. Precision medicine aims to change this by using individual genetic information (along with lifestyle and environmental data) to tailor prevention and treatment.

For example, two cancer patients might have tumors that look the same under a microscope but have different genetic mutations driving the cancer. Precision medicine allows doctors to identify these molecular differences and choose the therapy most likely to work for each specific patient. To make precision medicine a reality, researchers need to understand the genetic basis of diseases — which is exactly what students learn to investigate during this camp.

### Using OMIM
OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) is a freely available database that catalogs all known human genetic disorders and their associated genes. When you search for a disease in OMIM, you can find which genes are involved, what chromosome they are on, how the disease is inherited (dominant, recessive, X-linked), and detailed clinical descriptions.

During Day 1, students use OMIM to research their group's assigned disease. This is the starting point of the research pipeline: knowing which genes are associated with your disease allows you to later look for changes in those genes when analyzing gene expression data. OMIM entries are curated by scientists and regularly updated, making it a reliable primary source for genetic disease information.

### Ethics and Genetic Data
As genetic sequencing becomes cheaper and more widespread, important ethical questions arise. Who owns your genetic data? Can it be used against you? The GINA Act (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, signed into law in 2008) addresses some of these concerns by making it illegal for health insurance companies and employers to discriminate based on genetic information.

However, GINA has limitations — it does not cover life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. Additionally, direct-to-consumer genetic testing raises questions about data privacy: when you send your DNA to a testing company, what happens to that data? These ethical dimensions are an important part of being a responsible scientist, and students are encouraged to think critically about the social implications of genomic research throughout the week.

## How It Connects
- **Previous Day**: This is Day 1 — the foundation for everything that follows. The biology concepts (genes, chromosomes, DNA) and the OMIM research set the stage for all subsequent analyses.
- **Next Day**: On Day 2, you will learn about gene expression and microarrays — the technology that lets you measure which genes are active in a cell. Your OMIM research from today will help you understand which genes to look for when you start analyzing expression data.

## Review Questions
1. How many base pairs are in the human genome, approximately?
2. What is the difference between a monogenic disease and a polygenic disease? Give an example of each.
3. Describe one way precision medicine could improve treatment for cancer patients compared to traditional medicine.
4. You search for "Marfan syndrome" in OMIM. What type of information would you expect to find?
5. What does the GINA Act protect, and what are its limitations?
6. Why is it important for researchers to consider ethics when working with genetic data?
7. If you were explaining precision medicine to a family member, what analogy or example would you use?
8. How does the work you did today with OMIM connect to the microarray analysis you will do later this week?
