## Concept Summaries

### Synthesizing a Week of Research
Over the past four days, you have followed a complete bioinformatics research pipeline. On Day 1, you used OMIM to understand the genetic basis of your disease and identify associated genes. On Day 2, you learned about gene expression and microarrays, then selected a GEO dataset. On Day 3, you applied statistics to identify differentially expressed genes using GEO2R, learned to read volcano plots, and exported your results. On Day 4, you used STRING to find protein interactions and enriched biological processes, and explored KEGG pathways.

Today, the challenge is to weave all of these individual steps into a coherent story. Your presentation should not simply describe each tool you used in sequence. Instead, it should tell the story of your disease: what it is, how you investigated it, what you found, and what it means. Each tool and database is a step in the narrative, not an isolated technique. The strongest presentations connect findings from different analyses — for instance, showing that a gene identified on OMIM also appeared as significantly differentially expressed in your GEO2R results AND was part of an enriched pathway in STRING.

### Building an Effective Presentation
Scientific presentations follow a standard structure for a reason: it guides the audience through your thinking process. Start with the Introduction (why this disease matters, what genes are involved), then describe your Methods (what tools you used and how), present your Results (what you found — volcano plots, top genes, STRING networks, GO enrichment), offer a Discussion (what do the results mean for understanding the disease), and close with Social Impact (why it matters beyond the lab).

Slide design is critical for communication. Each slide should have a clear purpose and convey one main idea. Use figures — your volcano plot, STRING network image, and KEGG pathway diagrams — as the centerpieces of your slides, not decorations. Label them clearly and explain them verbally during your talk. Text should be minimal: bullet points, not paragraphs. If your audience has to choose between reading your slide and listening to you, you have too much text. Practice speaking to the audience rather than reading from the slides.

### The Social Impact of Genetic Disease
Science exists within a social context, and understanding the social impact of a disease is an essential part of being a responsible researcher. When you investigate a genetic disease, you are not just studying molecules — you are studying a condition that affects real people, families, and communities.

Social impact includes several dimensions. Prevalence tells you how widespread the disease is. Demographics reveal whether certain populations are disproportionately affected — for example, sickle cell disease primarily affects people of African descent, while cystic fibrosis is most common in people of Northern European ancestry. Healthcare access raises questions about whether effective treatments exist and whether they are affordable and available to everyone who needs them. Ethical considerations address issues like genetic testing, privacy, stigma, and discrimination. A complete research presentation addresses these dimensions because they determine who benefits (and who does not) from scientific advances.

### The Complete Research Pipeline
Looking back at the entire week, you have followed the same research pipeline used by professional bioinformaticians worldwide. This pipeline has a logic to it: each step builds on the previous one.

The pipeline begins with a research question: what genetic factors contribute to a specific disease? OMIM provides the known gene-disease associations from decades of clinical genetics research. GEO provides actual experimental data (microarray gene expression measurements) that allows you to see which genes are behaving abnormally in diseased tissue. GEO2R applies statistics to separate real signals from noise, producing a ranked list of differentially expressed genes. STRING and GO enrichment analysis reveal the biological functions and pathways represented in your gene list, transforming a collection of gene names into biological understanding. KEGG pathways provide the molecular-level detail of how these processes work. And your final presentation communicates all of this to others.

This pipeline is not limited to this camp — it is a genuine research approach used in published scientific studies. The skills you practiced this week (database searching, statistical analysis, network analysis, scientific communication) are directly transferable to college coursework, research internships, and professional careers in biomedical science.

### The miRcore Community Beyond Camp
The camp concludes with presentations to peers, group leaders, and during the parent session, to families. Dr. Lee described the miRcore Volunteer Program (MVP), through which camp alumni can continue their research throughout the school year, developing deeper expertise and leadership skills. Former miRcore students have gone on to study at institutions including Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Yale, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, and others.

The Citizen Scientist Sequencing Initiative (CSSI) was also introduced as a project exploring how individuals can own their own genome sequence without sharing it with anyone else, including miRcore. This connects back to the Day 1 ethics discussion about data ownership and genetic privacy, demonstrating that these are not abstract concerns but active areas of innovation.

## How It Connects
- **Previous Day**: On Day 4, you completed your data analysis pipeline with STRING, GO enrichment, and KEGG pathways. Today, you synthesize ALL of the week's work into a presentation and add the social impact perspective.
- **Beyond Camp**: The research skills and pipeline you learned this week (OMIM -> GEO -> GEO2R -> STRING -> KEGG -> Presentation) form a complete foundation for bioinformatics research. Students who join the miRcore Volunteer Program can deepen this research over months and years, eventually presenting at conferences.

## Review Questions
1. List the complete research pipeline you followed this week, from Day 1 to Day 5, naming each tool and what it contributed to your research.
2. Why should a research presentation follow the structure of Introduction -> Methods -> Results -> Discussion -> Social Impact?
3. What makes a slide effective versus ineffective? Give two examples of each.
4. Your group found that "apoptotic process" is the most enriched biological process in your gene list for a neurodegenerative disease. How would you explain this finding to a non-scientist audience?
5. Describe two ways in which health disparities can affect who benefits from genetic research.
6. How did the genes you found in OMIM on Day 1 relate to (or differ from) the genes that came up as most differentially expressed in your GEO2R analysis?
7. If you were to continue this research beyond camp, what would your next step be?
8. In what ways are the bioinformatics skills you learned this week used by professional researchers in real-world medicine?
