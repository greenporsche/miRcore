# CB Day 1 Cheat Sheet: Genes, Disease, and Precision Medicine

## Commands & Tools
| Tool/Command | What It Does | Example Usage |
|---|---|---|
| OMIM (omim.org) | Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man — database for searching genetic diseases and associated genes | Search "sickle cell anemia" to find gene associations |
| Zulip | Team communication platform used during camp | Post in the general stream for discussions |
| Google Docs | Collaborative document for group research notes | Share disease research findings with your group |

## Key Concepts
- **Precision Medicine**: Tailoring medical treatment to individual characteristics (genes, environment, lifestyle) rather than one-size-fits-all approaches
- **Gene**: A segment of DNA that contains instructions for building proteins; humans have approximately 20,000–25,000 genes
- **Chromosome**: A structure made of DNA and proteins; humans have 23 pairs (46 total)
- **Base Pair (bp)**: The paired nucleotides (A-T, C-G) that form the rungs of the DNA double helix; the human genome has ~3 billion base pairs
- **Genomics**: The study of an organism's complete set of DNA, including all genes and their interactions
- **Biomarker**: A measurable indicator of a biological state or condition used in diagnostics
- **GINA Act**: Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act — U.S. law that prohibits discrimination based on genetic information in health insurance and employment
- **Phenotype**: Observable traits or characteristics of an organism (e.g., eye color, disease symptoms)
- **Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an organism at a specific set of genes

## File Formats
- **Google Doc**: Used for collaborative group research documents — introduced Day 1 for note-taking
- **Zulip posts**: Discussion threads for daily check-ins and Q&A

## Databases & URLs
| Resource | URL | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| OMIM | https://omim.org | Looking up genetic diseases, finding associated genes, understanding inheritance patterns |
| Zulip | (camp-specific link) | Daily communication, polls, discussions |

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing a gene with a protein — a gene is the DNA instruction; the protein is the product
- Assuming one gene causes one disease — many diseases are polygenic (involving multiple genes)
- Mixing up chromosomes and genes — chromosomes contain many genes
- Not reading the full OMIM entry — students often stop at the summary and miss key gene associations
- Forgetting to record your OMIM findings in the shared group research document

## Quick Check
1. What is the difference between current medicine and precision medicine?
2. How many base pairs does the human genome contain (approximately)?
3. What does the GINA Act protect against?
4. If you want to find which genes are associated with a specific disease, which database would you use?
5. Why is it important to consider ethics when using genetic data?
