# CB Day 5 Cheat Sheet: Research Presentations and Social Impact

## Commands & Tools
| Tool/Command | What It Does | Example Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Google Slides | Presentation software for building your final research talk | Create slides summarizing your disease research |
| Google Docs (research document) | Shared group document with all findings from the week | Reference your compiled data when building slides |
| Google Sheets (data) | Spreadsheet with GEO2R results, gene lists, and GO terms | Pull key statistics for presentation figures |
| OMIM | Cross-reference disease-gene information for your introduction slides | Verify gene names and disease associations |
| STRING | Reference your saved network images and enrichment results | Include network diagram in presentation |

## Key Concepts
- **Research Presentation Structure**: Introduction (disease background) -> Methods (tools used) -> Results (key findings) -> Discussion (interpretation) -> Social Impact
- **Social Impact**: How your disease of focus affects communities, healthcare systems, and society; includes disparities, access to treatment, and ethical considerations
- **Slide Design**: Keep text minimal, use visuals (volcano plots, STRING networks, KEGG pathways), practice speaking to the audience rather than reading slides
- **Citing Sources**: Reference the databases and tools you used (OMIM, GEO, GEO2R, STRING, KEGG)
- **Peer Review**: Presenting your findings to your camp peers and receiving constructive feedback
- **Daily Diagnostic**: Quick review quiz given at the start of each day to reinforce key concepts from the previous day
- **Cheat Sheet Awards**: Recognition given to students who maintain the most thorough and well-organized reference notes throughout the week

## Presentation Checklist
- [ ] Disease background and significance (from OMIM research on Day 1)
- [ ] Key genes associated with your disease
- [ ] Microarray data source (which GEO dataset, sample sizes)
- [ ] Volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes
- [ ] Top differentially expressed genes (table or list)
- [ ] STRING network image with key interactions highlighted
- [ ] GO enrichment results — top biological processes
- [ ] KEGG pathway relevant to your disease
- [ ] Social impact discussion
- [ ] Conclusions and future directions

## Databases & URLs
| Resource | URL | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| OMIM | https://omim.org | Disease background for introduction |
| NCBI GEO | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ | Citing your dataset source |
| STRING | https://string-db.org | Network analysis figures |
| KEGG | https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ | Pathway diagrams |
| GEO2R | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/ | Methods section — how you identified differentially expressed genes |

## Common Pitfalls
- Putting too much text on slides — use bullet points and images, not paragraphs
- Not practicing the presentation — rehearse with your group before presenting
- Forgetting to explain what your volcano plot or STRING network shows — do not assume the audience can read the figure without guidance
- Not connecting your GO terms back to your disease — explain WHY enrichment of a particular pathway makes sense for your disease
- Ignoring social impact — this is a critical part of the presentation that connects science to real-world consequences
- Not crediting the tools and databases you used in your methods section

## Quick Check
1. What are the main sections of a research presentation?
2. Why is it important to discuss the social impact of a genetic disease?
3. What visual elements from your week's research should appear in your presentation?
4. How should you explain a volcano plot to an audience that has never seen one?
5. What is the connection between the genes you found on Day 1 (OMIM) and the gene expression data you analyzed on Days 2-4?
