# CB Day 1 Exercises: Genes, Disease, and Precision Medicine

## Warm-Up Questions
1. In your own words, what is the difference between a gene and a chromosome?
2. Why might two patients with the same disease respond differently to the same medication?
3. Name one reason why it is important to have laws like the GINA Act when genetic testing becomes more common.

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Exploring OMIM
**Objective**: Learn to navigate the OMIM database and find gene-disease associations.
**Instructions**:
1. Go to [OMIM](https://omim.org).
2. Search for **sickle cell anemia**.
3. Find and record the following:
   - The gene most commonly associated with sickle cell anemia
   - The chromosome where this gene is located
   - The inheritance pattern (dominant, recessive, or X-linked)
4. Write a 2–3 sentence summary of what causes sickle cell anemia at the molecular level, based on what you read in the OMIM entry.

**Expected Output**: A short summary that identifies the HBB gene on chromosome 11 and describes the single nucleotide change that leads to abnormal hemoglobin.

### Exercise 2: Disease Comparison
**Objective**: Practice using OMIM to compare two genetic diseases.
**Instructions**:
1. Choose two diseases from the list below:
   - Cystic fibrosis
   - Huntington's disease
   - Down syndrome
   - Marfan syndrome
2. For each disease, use OMIM to find:
   - The primary gene(s) involved
   - The chromosome location
   - Whether it is caused by a single gene or multiple genes
3. Create a comparison table with your findings.

**Expected Output**: A table with two rows (one per disease) and columns for disease name, gene(s), chromosome, and single-gene vs. multi-gene.

### Exercise 3: Precision Medicine Scenarios
**Objective**: Apply the concept of precision medicine to real-world scenarios.
**Instructions**:
Read each scenario and answer the question:

**Scenario A**: A doctor discovers that Patient X has a specific mutation in gene BRCA1. Based on this, the doctor recommends a targeted therapy designed for patients with BRCA1 mutations, rather than standard chemotherapy.
- Is this an example of current medicine or precision medicine? Explain why.

**Scenario B**: Two children are diagnosed with asthma. Both receive the same inhaler prescription.
- Is this an example of current medicine or precision medicine? What could a precision medicine approach look like instead?

**Expected Output**: Written answers (2–3 sentences each) explaining the distinction and giving a precision medicine alternative for Scenario B.

### Exercise 4: Ethics Discussion
**Objective**: Think critically about the ethical implications of genetic data.
**Instructions**:
1. Imagine a health insurance company gains access to your full genome sequence.
2. Write a short paragraph (4–5 sentences) answering: What could go wrong? How does the GINA Act protect you? Are there any gaps in that protection?
3. Discuss with your group: Should employers ever be allowed to see genetic test results? Why or why not?

**Expected Output**: A written paragraph and group discussion notes.

## Challenge Problems

### Challenge 1: Tracing a Genetic Disease Through a Family
**Objective**: Apply knowledge of inheritance patterns to a pedigree.
**Instructions**:
A family has the following pattern:
- Grandmother (unaffected) and Grandfather (affected with disease X)
- Their daughter (unaffected carrier) married an unaffected man
- They have four children: two unaffected daughters, one affected son, one unaffected son

1. Based on this pattern, is disease X likely autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive?
2. Use OMIM to find a real disease that matches this inheritance pattern.
3. Draw or describe the pedigree chart.

### Challenge 2: Connecting Genes to Precision Medicine
**Objective**: Research a disease and propose a precision medicine approach.
**Instructions**:
1. Use OMIM to research **phenylketonuria (PKU)**.
2. Identify the gene involved and what protein it encodes.
3. Explain how newborn screening for PKU is an example of precision medicine in practice.
4. Propose one additional way precision medicine could help PKU patients in the future.

## Answer Key

### Warm-Up Answers
1. A gene is a specific segment of DNA that codes for a protein, while a chromosome is a large structure made of DNA that contains many genes. Humans have about 20,000–25,000 genes spread across 23 pairs of chromosomes.
2. Different patients may have different genetic variations that affect how their bodies metabolize drugs or respond to treatment. Precision medicine aims to account for these differences.
3. As genetic testing becomes widespread, there is a risk that employers or insurance companies could discriminate against people based on their genetic predisposition to certain diseases. The GINA Act makes this illegal.

### Exercise Answers
1. **OMIM Exploration**: Sickle cell anemia is primarily associated with the HBB (hemoglobin subunit beta) gene located on chromosome 11 (11p15.4). It follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. A single nucleotide change (GAG to GTG) causes the amino acid substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 6, producing abnormal hemoglobin S that causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped.

2. **Disease Comparison** (example using cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease):

| Feature | Cystic Fibrosis | Huntington's Disease |
|---|---|---|
| Gene(s) | CFTR | HTT |
| Chromosome | 7 (7q31.2) | 4 (4p16.3) |
| Single/Multi-gene | Single gene | Single gene |
| Inheritance | Autosomal recessive | Autosomal dominant |

3. **Precision Medicine Scenarios**:
   - Scenario A: This is precision medicine because the treatment is tailored to the patient's specific genetic mutation (BRCA1) rather than using a general approach.
   - Scenario B: This is current medicine (one-size-fits-all). A precision medicine approach might involve testing each child's genetic profile to determine which type of asthma they have and prescribing a targeted therapy.

4. **Ethics Discussion**: Sample answer — If an insurance company had access to my genome, they could identify my genetic risk for diseases like cancer or heart disease and potentially deny coverage or charge higher premiums. The GINA Act protects against discrimination in health insurance and employment based on genetic information. However, GINA does not cover life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance, which represents a gap in protection.

### Challenge Answers
1. **Pedigree Analysis**: The inheritance pattern (unaffected carrier mother, affected son, unaffected father) is most consistent with **X-linked recessive** inheritance. The grandfather passed his X chromosome to his daughter (making her a carrier), and she has a 50% chance of passing the affected X to each son. A matching real disease from OMIM would be Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD gene on Xp21.2) or hemophilia A (F8 gene on Xq28).

2. **PKU Research**: PKU is caused by mutations in the PAH gene (phenylalanine hydroxylase) on chromosome 12 (12q23.2). The PAH protein converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. Newborn screening (the heel prick test) detects elevated phenylalanine levels within days of birth, allowing immediate dietary intervention — this is precision medicine because it identifies at-risk individuals before symptoms appear. A future approach could include gene therapy to correct the PAH mutation, or enzyme replacement therapy tailored to the specific mutation type.
