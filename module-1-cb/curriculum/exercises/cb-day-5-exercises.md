# CB Day 5 Exercises: Research Presentations and Social Impact

## Warm-Up Questions
1. Name the five major databases and tools you used this week and briefly describe what each one does.
2. In one sentence, what is the main finding your group discovered about your disease of focus?
3. Why is it important to include social impact when presenting scientific research?

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Building Your Research Narrative
**Objective**: Organize your week's research into a logical story for your presentation.
**Instructions**:
Complete the following research narrative template for your group:

1. **Disease Background** (from Day 1):
   - What disease did your group study?
   - What gene(s) are associated with it (from OMIM)?
   - Who does this disease affect (demographics, prevalence)?

2. **Data Source** (from Day 2):
   - What GEO dataset did you use? (GSE number)
   - How many samples were in the control group? Disease group?
   - What tissue type was studied?

3. **Key Findings** (from Days 3–4):
   - How many genes were significantly differentially expressed (adj. p-value < 0.05)?
   - List your top 3 up-regulated genes and top 3 down-regulated genes with their log2FC values.
   - What were the top 3 enriched biological processes from STRING?

4. **Interpretation**:
   - How do the enriched biological processes connect to your disease?
   - Did any of the top genes match the genes you found on OMIM on Day 1?
   - What is your hypothesis about why these pathways are disrupted?

**Expected Output**: A completed narrative document that covers all four sections.

### Exercise 2: Slide Design Workshop
**Objective**: Create effective presentation slides that communicate your research visually.
**Instructions**:
Create the following slides in Google Slides:

**Slide 1 — Title Slide**: Disease name, group members' names, date, miRcore Summer Camp

**Slide 2 — Disease Background**: 3–4 bullet points about your disease, an image, and the gene(s) from OMIM

**Slide 3 — Methods**: List the tools you used (OMIM, GEO, GEO2R, STRING, KEGG) and briefly describe your analysis pipeline in 3–4 steps

**Slide 4 — Volcano Plot**: Include your volcano plot (screenshot from GEO2R or hand-drawn from Day 3) with labels pointing to key genes

**Slide 5 — STRING Network**: Screenshot of your STRING network with a note about what the clusters represent

**Slide 6 — GO Enrichment Results**: Table or list of your top 5 enriched biological processes with brief definitions

**Slide 7 — KEGG Pathway**: A pathway diagram with your genes highlighted

**Slide 8 — Social Impact**: How this disease affects communities, access to treatment, health disparities, ethical considerations

**Slide 9 — Conclusions**: 3–4 key takeaways from your research

**Slide 10 — References**: List all databases and sources used

Design tips:
- Maximum 5–6 bullet points per slide
- Use images and figures, not walls of text
- Font size at least 24pt for body text
- Use consistent colors throughout

**Expected Output**: A 10-slide Google Slides presentation.

### Exercise 3: Social Impact Research
**Objective**: Investigate the social dimensions of your disease of focus.
**Instructions**:
Research and write responses to the following for your disease:
1. **Prevalence**: How many people are affected worldwide? In the United States?
2. **Demographics**: Are certain populations more affected than others (by ethnicity, age, sex, geography)?
3. **Healthcare Access**: Is treatment available? Is it affordable? Are there disparities in who receives treatment?
4. **Ethical Considerations**: Are there genetic testing issues, stigma, or privacy concerns related to this disease?
5. **Current Research**: What is one recent advancement in treatment or understanding of this disease?

Write a 1–2 paragraph summary that weaves these facts into a coherent social impact narrative for your presentation.

**Expected Output**: A written social impact summary with specific statistics and facts.

### Exercise 4: Presentation Practice
**Objective**: Rehearse your presentation and receive peer feedback.
**Instructions**:
1. Each group member should be assigned 2–3 slides to present.
2. Practice your full presentation within your group (aim for 5–7 minutes total).
3. As you listen to your groupmates, provide feedback using this rubric:

| Criterion | Score (1–5) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Clarity of explanation | | |
| Visual quality of slides | | |
| Connection between slides (does the story flow?) | | |
| Understanding of scientific content | | |
| Social impact discussion | | |
| Time management | | |

4. Revise your slides and delivery based on group feedback.

**Expected Output**: A practiced presentation with completed peer feedback rubrics.

## Challenge Problems

### Challenge 1: Cross-Group Comparison
**Objective**: Compare your findings with another group studying a different disease.
**Instructions**:
1. After presentations, find a group that studied a different disease.
2. Compare your results:
   - Do you share any enriched biological processes? Which ones?
   - Are any of the same genes differentially expressed in both diseases?
   - What biological processes are unique to each disease?
3. Write a short paragraph (3–4 sentences) explaining what the similarities and differences might mean biologically.
4. Reflect: Could the shared pathways represent general disease mechanisms, while the unique pathways explain what makes each disease distinct?

### Challenge 2: From Research to Treatment
**Objective**: Think forward from your findings to potential therapeutic applications.
**Instructions**:
Based on your week's research:
1. Pick the single most interesting enriched biological process from your STRING analysis.
2. Research whether any existing drugs target this pathway.
3. If a drug exists:
   - What is it called?
   - How does it work?
   - Is it currently used for your disease, or a different one?
4. If no drug exists:
   - Propose a hypothetical therapeutic strategy: Would you try to up-regulate or down-regulate the pathway? Why?
   - What type of therapy might work (small molecule drug, gene therapy, antibody therapy)?
5. Write a "future directions" paragraph (4–5 sentences) that could serve as the final statement of your presentation.

## Answer Key

### Warm-Up Answers
1. Five tools: (1) OMIM — database for genetic diseases and associated genes; (2) NCBI GEO — repository of gene expression datasets; (3) GEO2R — tool for comparing expression between sample groups; (4) STRING — protein interaction network and enrichment analysis; (5) KEGG — biological pathway maps showing how genes and proteins interact in cellular processes.
2. Answers vary by group. Example: "We found that genes involved in inflammatory response and apoptosis are significantly up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue compared to healthy controls."
3. Science does not exist in a vacuum. Understanding social impact helps researchers prioritize which diseases to study, ensures equitable access to treatments, and communicates why the research matters to the broader public.

### Exercise Answers
1. **Research Narrative**: Answers are group-specific. Key checkpoints: all four sections should be complete with specific gene names, GSE numbers, log2FC values, and GO terms — not generic placeholder text.

2. **Slide Design**: Evaluated on adherence to the 10-slide structure, visual clarity, appropriate use of figures, and minimal text per slide.

3. **Social Impact**: Answers vary by disease. Should include specific numbers and statistics, not vague claims. Should address at least 4 of the 5 categories.

4. **Presentation Practice**: Evaluated on completion of practice run and quality of peer feedback.

### Challenge Answers
1. **Cross-Group Comparison**: Common shared processes often include general stress response, cell cycle regulation, or immune response pathways. Disease-specific processes provide insight into what makes each disease unique at the molecular level. Shared pathways may represent common cellular responses to damage, while unique pathways point to specific disease mechanisms.

2. **From Research to Treatment**: Answers vary by disease and selected pathway. Students should demonstrate understanding that targeting a pathway therapeutically requires knowing whether it needs to be activated or inhibited. The "future directions" paragraph should be specific and grounded in the student's actual findings, not generic statements about "more research needed."
